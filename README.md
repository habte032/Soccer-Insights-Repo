# Soccer Insights Project by Habtemariam Kibru

## Overview
Welcome to the Soccer Insights Project! My name is Habtemariam Kibru, and I've conducted in-depth analytics on soccer data using three main files: a SQLite database and two CSV files. The CSV files were seamlessly integrated into the SQLite database, serving as the foundation for the comprehensive analysis presented here.

## Project Highlights
- **Data Sources:**
  - SQLite Database: Houses the core soccer data.
  - CSV Files: Two supplementary CSV files were merged into the SQLite database, enriching the dataset.

## Project Structure
1. **Import Libraries:**
   - Utilized popular Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning.

2. **Data Integration:**
   - Loaded a SQLite database.
   - Loaded the CSV files into pandas DataFrames.
   - Inserted the DataFrames as tables into the SQLite database.

3. **Data Wrangling:**
   - Handled missing values and outliers.
   - Cleaned and transformed data for analysis.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Addressed key questions:
     - Who are the players with the best finishing?

     - Which teams improved the most over the time period?
